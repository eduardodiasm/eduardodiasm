<h1> Hey, you! ðŸ‘‹ </h1>

<h2>Who I am</h2>

<p>
I am Eduardo Dias, a 17 years old software engineer, fascinated by innovation and technology.
I transform complex business models into code. Over 2 years of experience building products to solve real problems of companies through hackathons. I really like to be part of an end to end product development, from the brainstorm/ideation to the code and fundraise.
